						So you might be wondering why I began this website, how this information could benefit you, and what does this site offer compared to others?
					</p>
					<p>
						For starters, as a customer service agent working for a major radio-controlled plane and helicopter company, I come in to contact with hundreds
						 of people a week asking questions about all genres of RC flight. I am personally exposed to problems that arise, feedback from testing and the
						 solutions to counter these issues, which gives me an advantage others simply wonâ€™t have.
					</p>
					<p>
						Working on a team with four other individuals, some of which are professional pilots, we have a combined one hundred plus years of RC experience
						 and I have the pleasure of drawing from that knowledge pool as well. It has also helped me to understand the most common misunderstood conceptions
						 people have, and ways I can be of service to them.
					</p>
					<p>
						I enjoy filling in the gaps so customers can get a better understanding of these products and how to more effectively use them, which leads to
						 greater enjoyment of the hobby. My job also keeps me up-to-date on the latest technologies coming out in the RC industry, and just like
						 everything else in the world, advancements in electronics are making more things possible everyday. Part of the requirements as an employee
						 of Motion RC, I am expected to learn these new products and in turn, instruct others via email, chat or over the phone. This represents a
						 challenge as not all individuals learn the same way. I have to be creative in explaining the product or giving instructions, which is
						 something I pride myself on being able to accomplish.
					</p>
					<p>
						This website is one of many tools I will utilize to teach needed information effectively to others. Can one person truly know everything about
						 RC planes and helicopters? Definitely not. Some may give the impression that they do, but I assure you, they do not. This is not a website intended
						 to convey that I know everything about this industry, just a humble site to share information and perhaps get those burning questions answered.
