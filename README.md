This project was chosen as it was an assignment to create a website for an actual client. The person we found to make a website for wanted us to create a site that showcased the model airplanes that he had for sale. Our team needed to work with vague requirements of the client to create the site he wanted. Working on this project also showed the reality of a team project where someone is unreliable and stops communication and stops working on their portion of the project; this required our team to adjust our workload near the deadline to ensure that the product was delivered on time.
