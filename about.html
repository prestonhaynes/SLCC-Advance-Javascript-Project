						<p>Hello all, my name is Derek Mares and I am a customer service specialist for Motion RC. I handle customer service inquiries regarding building, programming, troubleshooting, and any other product quality questions that arise. My passion for the radio controlled hobby began at the age of eight when my mom purchased my first remote controlled car. Over a decade later in 1989, I received my first nitro powered 40-size trainer airplane and started to fly. I loved it, but in those days you had to build the plane from the ground up, the Balsa wood kits I bought took months to build. It was a tedious process, not to mention the time spent breaking in the motor, adjusting the fuel to air ratio, idle and full throttle power. I left the hobby for a number of years, but in 2001, I returned. Due to all the new advancements, the hobby started calling to me again.</p>
						<p>Technological advances have come so far and we are living in the golden age of RC aircraft. With wonderful flight simulators a person can learn to fly right in the comfort of their own home and never have to worry about a crash, bad weather or costly repairs. This time, I began my journey on the computer where I was flying helicopters and planes the same day as I purchased the software. My first helicopter was from Tower Hobbies and was a complete piece of junk, and the second one was not much better. So, for a while I gave up on the helicopters took down the old nitro plane and got it going again.</p>
						<p>One day I walked into my local model train store and the owner was flying a Blade helicopter from Horizon Hobby. I liked it so much, I bought one from him, yes, from a model train dealer. I was hooked and it flew great, so I moved from a counter rotation setup to a fixed pitch. Soon after that, I moved on to the Blade nanos with variable pitch, followed by a 230S, then a 500X, and recently a large 600 series scale Roban UH-1N. Electric gyros have contributed so much to this in that they have made helicopters so much more controllable for the average pilot by adding a great deal of stability not found before in these aircraft. Not to mention, the computer radios for there mixing capabilities and adjustable controls.</p>
						<p>Airplanes as well have come along way since my initial purchase. In my opinion, the foam construction and advanced electronics in conjunction with onboard gyros, much like the helicopters, has brought such an amazing new level to flying an RC plane. Youâ€™re talking ease of construction, less mess, no fuel, less noise, no internal combustion motor, most come painted, not to mention most of the electronics are installed, these plane designs would not have feasible without these latest advancements. Take for instance the jet aircraft models, which would not be possible without foam construction to the average RC pilot. Last but not least, is the extremely reduced cost to own, lower purchasing prices, cheaper replacement parts and most shipping is free which minimizes the out-of-pocket expenses involved with flying and maintaining these beautiful aircraft. All of which are powered by a simple modern lithium-ion battery and state of the art chargers.</p>
						<p>For many years now, I have been an enthusiast in multiple genres ranging from cars, boats, drones, helicopters and airplanes. I enjoy everything about the hobby from the challenge of building, modifying and tuning, to the detail work and finally being able to operate the vehicle. My attention has varied throughout the years, but as of late, I am most interested in scale flight. Scale flight is the capacity to create a model, make it look realistic and operate it to appear as a real-life functioning piece of machinery.</p>
						<p>If you have not looked at RC aircraft recently, but have always had a tug at your heart, there has never been a better time to give it a good look. My hope for this website is to help those who might be curious, those looking for how-to tips or persons on their own road of discovery and need some light shed on their path. Please enjoy the site as I add to it and feel free to drop me a line.</p>
						<p>Thank you,</p>
						<p>Derek</p>
